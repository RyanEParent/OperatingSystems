Booting: The operating system is designed in such a way that when the hardware is booted, the power supply sends an electrical current to circuitry in the computer. Then the processor chip resets itself due to the electricity, and seeks the firmware that contains the start up instructions. Upon success, the operating system in memory takes control of the computer and loads the system configuration information. After a security check if prompted, the user interface loads onto the screen, and any start up applications run as well.
