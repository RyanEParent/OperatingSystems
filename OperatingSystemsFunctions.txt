Booting: The operating system is designed in such a way that when the hardware is booted, the power supply sends an electrical current to circuitry in the computer. Then the processor chip resets itself due to the electricity, and seeks the firmware that contains the start up instructions. Upon success, the operating system in memory takes control of the computer and loads the system configuration information. After a security check if prompted, the user interface loads onto the screen, and any start up applications run as well.

User interface (UI): A UI controls how you enter instructions and data, and how the information is portrayed on the screen. With a graphical interface (GUI), you interact with menus and images. In a command-line interface, a user types commands that are represented by keywords, or special key presses to enter data instructions. With a natural user interface (NUI), users interact with the software through intuitive behavior which includes touch screens (touch input), gesture recognition (motion input), and speech recognition (voice input).
